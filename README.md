<h1 align="left">Data Mining Iteration OSAS and BSAS</h1>

<p  align="left" style="font-size: 14px;">
The Data Mining and Big Data project is an Iteration focusing  on developing and implementing a prototypical Data Mining and Big Data Analytics Solution to address the growing effects of Climate Change one of the 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals of the UN.
It uses concepts like Open Source Analytical Solutions (OSAS) and Big Data Analytical Solutions (BDAS) to implement 8 important Cross - Industry Standard processes for Data Mining

<ul>
  <li>Situation Understanding</li>
  <li>Data Understanding</li>
  <li>Data Preparation </li>
  <li>Data Transformation </li>
  <li> Data-Mining method selection</li>
  <li> Data-Mining algorithm(s) selection</li>
  <li> Data Mining</li>
  <li> Interpretation</li>
  </ul>

 The iteration uses two frameworks for two different Analytical Solutions. It uses Python, Pandas and sk-learn libraries for OSAS. 
 And PySpark Algorithms and Visualizations for BDAS.

<p> 
The repository has two ipynb files one focusing on OSAS and one on BDAS. Both have been saved directly from Google Colab so opening either would directly lead to the file.
  It also contains csv extension files of the datasets used for the Iterations. Two pdf files have been presented which entails the total documentation of both the Iterations OSAS and 
  BDAS.
